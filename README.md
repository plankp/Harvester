# Harvester

Another game with screen abuse (Took a lot from my previous prototype: [Atoiks-Games/Screening](https://github.com/atoiks-games/Screening))

## Build Instructions

You need jdk 8 or above.

Run `gradlew build` to build it or `gradlew run` to run after building

## Game Instructions

*   Over time, plants will spawn randomly in the field
*   When this happens, the screen will flash and beep
*   Click on grass or flowers to harvest them (a.k.a **_gain points_**)

### Notes

*   Unharvested grass will grow into flowers
*   Leaving flowers unharvested for too long will cause them to wither (a.k.a **_game over_**)
*   Move the screen around to see the whole field (hence the screen abuse part~)
*   Hold `S` to access the score overlay. During this time, the game is paused!

## Assets Used

*   Logisoso font
*   [16x16 Outdoors Tileset](https://alexs-assets.itch.io/16x16-outdoors-tileset)
