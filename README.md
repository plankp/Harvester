# Harvester

Another game with screen abuse (Took a lot from my previous prototype: [Atoiks-Games/Screening](https://github.com/atoiks-games/Screening))

## Build Instructions

You need jdk 8 or above.

Run `gradlew build` to build it or `gradlew run` to run after building

## Game Instructions

*   If you see green, yellow or red tiles, click on them!
*   Move the screen around to see the whole field (hence the screen abuse part~)
*   Hold `S` to access the score overlay. During this time, the game is paused!
